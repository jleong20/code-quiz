# Code Quiz

## Description

This is an interactive quiz that will challenge you on
basic knowledge of JavaScript. This quiz includes a timer that will 
decrease for every wrong answer the user chooses until the timer reaches 0.
If the user selects the correct answer, the next question will prompt.
This quiz features a nice blue cornflower background and an interactive 
start button, which will start the timer. And also a question with 4 interactive
buttons for each answer. Answering incorrect will prompt a "wrong" message and deduct 
time off the timer. Answering the last question will end the game.
